# Recurrent Neural Networks Directory

## rnn\_lstm
This directory contains code for a custom RNN used to classify MNIST characters, as well as a custom LSTM network with the same objective.

## rnn\_lstm\_bin\_add
This directory contains code for a library implementation of an RNN and LSTM that learns to add binary numbers of length N, and outputs a result of length N+1.

## rnn\_seq
This directory contains code for a library implementation of an RNN (or similar) that learns to identify MNIST multiple digits in a wide picture of ten digits.

## gan
This directory contains code for a custom Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that has been trained to generate images of a chicken.
